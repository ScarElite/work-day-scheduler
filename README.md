# Work Day Scheduler

## About The Project
This website was created to provide you with a scheduler for your traditional 9am - 5pm work day and also displays the current day and date. Each time block has a middle section for you to input your task or other to-do description. The time block also has a blue Save button on the end for you to save your description so that it is not lost if you close the website and come back later to check it. Each time block also has a color indicator that helps you keep track of what tasks are in the past and should have been completed, what tasks are in the present time and should be worked on now, and what tasks are upcoming in the future.

## Built with:
